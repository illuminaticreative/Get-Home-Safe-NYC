			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Get Home Safe NYC is available for residents of New York City to update and discover the status of critical resources at their homes and apartments in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The website allows landlords and fellow residents to list their address and mark whether the residence has power, electricity, running water, working elevators (if applicable) or has experienced flooding. Most importantly, it will indicate if it is safe to return to the residence.</p>
